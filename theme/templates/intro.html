	            	<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"> the license</a>. This effort is inspired
	            	by <a href="http://www.image-net.org">ILSVRC</a> and many others making similar efforts to enable and
	            	accelerate machine learning techniques R&D. <a href="{{ GROUPURL }}">Our research</a> is
	            	development of machine learniing algorithms to extract as much physics as possible from data taken 
	            	by particle 2D/3D imaging detectors. The ultimate goal is to describe the full details of physics in
	            	each entry of data. What particles are in there (and where)? What is the hierarhcy among them (which 
	            	particle produced which)? What is the energy/momentum of particles? Is there a new physics (unseen 
	            	interactions) in the picture? By making our effort available in public domain, we wish to contribute
	            	toward one big goal, the development of A.I. to perform scientific research.
